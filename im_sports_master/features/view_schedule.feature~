Feature: View the schedule of a division
  
  As a team member
  So that I know when to show up for a game
  I want to be able to view the schedule of my team's division

  Background:
    Given the following users exist:
    | name       | email             | password  | password_confirmation  | admin  |
    | admin      | email@email.com   | password  | password               | true   |
    | user       | email2@email.com  | password  | password               | false  |

    Given the following leagues exist:
    | name    | sport      |
    | league1 | basketball |

    Given the following divisions exist:
    | name    | num_teams  | start_time  | end_time  | num_locations  | num_weeks | year | month | day | game_length  | league_id  |
    | testdiv | 8          | 8pm         | 10pm      | 2              | 7         | 2013 | 11    | 18  | 60           | 1          |

    Given the following teams exist:
    | captain_email      | name       | division_id | placeholder |
    | email2@email.com   | team1      | 1           | false       |

  Scenario: A user should be able to view his/her schedule via the division's page
    Given I am logged in as "email2@email.com" with password "password"
    And user with email "email2@email.com" is a member of "team1"
    And I am on the home page
    And I follow "league1"
    And I follow "testdiv"
    Then I should see "team1 vs. team2" or "team2 vs. team1"
    And I should see "team1 vs. team3" or "team3 vs. team1"
    And I should see "team1 vs. team4" or "team4 vs. team1"
    And I should see "team1 vs. team5" or "team5 vs. team1"
    And I should see "team1 vs. team6" or "team6 vs. team1"
    And I should see "team1 vs. team7" or "team7 vs. team1"
    And I should see "team1 vs. team8" or "team8 vs. team1"

  Scenario: A user should be able to view his/her schedule via the user's profile
    Given I am logged in as "email2@email.com" with password "password"
    And user with email "email2@email.com" is a member of "team1"
    And I am on the profile page for "email2@email.com"
    And I follow "team1"
    Then I should see "team1 vs. team2" or "team2 vs. team1"
    And I should see "team1 vs. team3" or "team3 vs. team1"
    And I should see "team1 vs. team4" or "team4 vs. team1"
    And I should see "team1 vs. team5" or "team5 vs. team1"
    And I should see "team1 vs. team6" or "team6 vs. team1"
